Let’s quote our good old friend [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet):

> _An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet outside our solar system that orbits a star._

do you know how many exoplanets that have been discovered? [**3,711 confirmed planets** as of 04/05/2018](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

##  How to detect it?
There are different [**detection methods**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets). Turns out there is one method heavily used, called **the transit method**. It’s like an eclipse: when the exoplanet is passing in front of the star, the photometry is varying during the transit, as shown below:

To recap, exoplanet detection using the transit method are in reality a **time series analysis problem**.

## Kepler/K2 mission

Kepler is a **space observatory** launched by NASA in March 2009 to discover Earth-sized planets orbiting other stars. [The loss of a reaction wheel during May 2013](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/nasas-k2-mission-the-kepler-space-telescopes-second-chance-to-shine) put an end to the original mission. Fortunately, scientists decided to create an entirely community-driven mission called K2, to **reuse the Kepler spacecraft and its assets**. But furthermore, the community is also encouraged to exploit the mission’s unique **open** data archive. Every image taken by the satellite can be downloaded and analyzed by all of us.

More information about the telescope itself can be found [here](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/the-kepler-space-telescope.html).

## Who are we?

![Alt Text]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/step-0/hew.png)

We are not astrophysicists. Not by far, we are **developers**, and WarpScript users looking for time series challenges. We want to have fun! So we created [HelloExoWorld](https://helloexo.world), an **association** designed to promote and use spatial data such as Kepler's.

#### What we have done:

* Downloaded and parsed 40M of FITS files
* Pushed it to a Warp10 instance
* Select a cool subset for you

#### What you have to do:

* Learn WarpScript and find some exoplanets!

## What does it look like?

Here's an observation of a star called Kepler-11:

Do you see the dropouts? **Those are transiting exoplanets!** Now we’ll need to write a WarpScript to automatically detect transits. First let's now discover some basics of WarpScript!
